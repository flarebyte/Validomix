/// The string validation library is designed to enforce validation rules on strings, triggered by various events, and to produce custom messages.
/// It applies a series of validation rules, such as size and format checks, to input strings through a rule enforcement system.
/// The rule definitions include abstract classes or interfaces for different validation rules, with concrete implementations handling specific checks like size and format.
/// A message generator produces generic messages based on validation results, with these messages being defined outside the library.
/// The communication flow involves the event manager triggering validations, the rule enforcement system applying the rules, and the message generator producing appropriate messages based on the validation outcomes.
/// These messages are then utilised by the client application. This structure ensures flexible and reusable string validation with a clear separation of concerns.
